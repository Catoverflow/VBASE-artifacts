# pgvector

Open-source vector similarity search for Postgres

```sql
CREATE TABLE table (column vector(3));
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (column);
SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column <-> '[1,2,3]' LIMIT 5;
```

Supports L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/pgvector/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ankane/pgvector/actions)

## Installation

Compile and install the extension (supports Postgres 9.6+)

```sh
git clone --branch v0.1.7 https://github.com/ankane/pgvector.git
cd pgvector
make
make install # may need sudo
```

Then load it in databases where you want to use it

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

You can also install it with [Docker](#docker), [Homebrew](#homebrew), or [PGXN](#pgxn)

### Building in Windows

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -T ClangCL ..
msbuild vector.sln
msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj
```

## Getting Started

Create a vector column with 3 dimensions (replace `table` and `column` with non-reserved names)

```sql
CREATE TABLE table (column vector(3));
```

Insert values

```sql
INSERT INTO table VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

Get the nearest neighbor by L2 distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 1;
```

Also supports inner product (`<#>`) and cosine distance (`<=>`)

Note: `<#>` returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports `ASC` order index scans on operators

## Indexing

Speed up queries with an approximate index. Add an index for each distance function you want to use.

L2 distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (column);
```

Inner product

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (column vector_ip_ops);
```

Cosine distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (column vector_cosine_ops);
```

Indexes should be created after the table has data for optimal clustering. Also, unlike typical indexes which only affect performance, you may see different results for queries after adding an approximate index.

### Index Options

Specify the number of inverted lists (100 by default)

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON table USING ivfflat (column) WITH (lists = 100);
```

### Query Options

Specify the number of probes (1 by default)

```sql
SET ivfflat.probes = 1;
```

A higher value improves recall at the cost of speed.

Use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL ivfflat.probes = 1;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

## Reference

### Vector Type

Each vector takes `4 * dimensions + 8` bytes of storage. Each element is a float, and all elements must be finite (no `NaN`, `Infinity` or `-Infinity`). Vectors can have up to 1024 dimensions.

### Vector Operators

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| \+       | element-wise addition    |
| \-       | element-wise subtraction |
| <->      | Euclidean distance       |
| <#>      | negative inner product   |
| <=>      | cosine distance          |

### Vector Functions

| Function                        | Description          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| cosine_distance(vector, vector) | cosine distance      |
| inner_product(vector, vector)   | inner product        |
| l2_distance(vector, vector)     | Euclidean distance   |
| vector_dims(vector)             | number of dimensions |
| vector_norm(vector)             | Euclidean norm       |

## Libraries

Libraries that use pgvector:

- [pgvector-python](https://github.com/ankane/pgvector-python) (Python)

## Additional Installation Methods

### Docker

Get the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ankane/pgvector) with:

```sh
docker pull ankane/pgvector
```

This adds pgvector to the [Postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

You can also build the image manually

```sh
git clone --branch v0.1.7 https://github.com/ankane/pgvector.git
cd pgvector
docker build -t pgvector .
```

### Homebrew

On Mac with Homebrew Postgres, you can use:

```sh
brew install ankane/brew/pgvector
```

### PGXN

Install from the [PostgreSQL Extension Network](https://pgxn.org/dist/vector) with:

```sh
pgxn install vector
```

## Hosted Postgres

Some Postgres providers only support specific extensions. To request a new extension:

- Google Cloud SQL - follow the instructions on [this page](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/extensions#requesting-support-for-a-new-extension)
- DigitalOcean Managed Databases - follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/resources/supported-extensions/#supported-extensions)
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL - follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-extensions#next-steps)

## Upgrading

Install the latest version and run:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION vector UPDATE;
```
